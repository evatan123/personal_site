Welcome to my Website!

#About me

Hi, everyone! I'm Wenwen from Beijing, China. I'm currently a graduate student in UMass-Amherst, major in biostatistics. Before coming to the US, I studied pharmacy for a Bachelor's degree in Wuhan University in China. I also traveled to Germany as an exchange student in Jena University, where I was lucky enough to become a research assistant in the lab of Prof. Oliver Werz, searching for new compounds to suppress the inflamation process in human body.

I like doing medical research and dealing with medical research data. R and SAS are the most often used computer softwares in our realm of study. Visualizing, manipulating and cleaning data using SAS and R are interesting. The truth behind the data also attracts me a lot.

When I'm free I like taking photographs, travelling and playing sports. Tennis and swimming are my favorite sports. I was once a volunteer in Wuhan Tennis Open Tournament, supervising the sports women's locker room. I saw a lot of famous tennis players during the game, which was very exciting!
